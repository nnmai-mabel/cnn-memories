    This is my first page ever created on HTML, which looks more like a blog.
    It might be a little bit clumsy, but I want to save the best of my high school life here.
    I hope that this page will still be able to run for decades!

      I just want to send my appreciation to all of my OGLs.

    This was the year I felt happiest of 3 years in CNN. 
    I had new relationships thanks to 10+, and Khue, the friend I really appreciated to have her as an important part of my highschool life, and I became best friends.
    Also, I have the chance to talk more and understand more about my classmates, became close friend with Nhi, Phuong Ha and Song Ha.

    Actually, this was the time I really enjoyed 10+ as an OGL. 
    I had the opportunity to experience 10+ from a different aspect, understood everything my OGLs had sacrificed for me.
    I really appreciate 10+ for giving me the chance to have new relationships with other friends in the same age, dance more, be more open and intimate to others.

  <p style="text-align:justify; margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
    Here are some photos with OG 19, the one who taught me to laugh more, to play more, to sacrifice more. 
    I'm really grateful to have you guys as a part of my CNN life.

We were the 50th generation of CNN students, and we had the chance to participate in the 50th establishment of the school.
we spent around 1 month to prepare for this really ceremony, and we performed in the National Convention Center, which was the biggest stage I have ever performed.
The night was livestreamed via Facebook; moreover, some performence video were posted on Youtube.
There were a lot performance from different language classes in CNN, personally, the performance of Japanese and German classes were the best that night.
This was a memorable event to me and all CNNers.

<p style="text-align:justify; margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
As I have said, this was my most enjoyable year at CNN, despite the fact that we went to Hola every year of highschool, I would talk the most about this one.
I had OG, I had my friends. 
Whatever happens, Hola is still a special memory.
We had a military week at Hoa Lac aka Hola, where we lived together, played together, did regular activities together.
We were under the same atmosphere, shared personal stories and learned more about each other.

<p style="text-align:justify; margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
Right at the middle of my grade 11, the global epidemic COVID-19 appeared. 
The school shut down and we had to stayed at home for more than 3 months, experienced the longest Tet holiday ever, which last until summer =)))

Despite not being so close with OG, we took a lot of photos together.
Now I wish I have more photos with my friends, as memories may fade, but photos will last for eternity.
Hope when I go to university, I will meet nice people and take photos with them, together create happy uni-time.

Grade 12

<p style="text-align:justify; margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
This might be a tough year to me, as I was not only snowed under with school work, I also felt my relationships with others fade away, including my best buddies.
They have new close friends, and the relationship with OG also faded away.
If I could turn back the time, I would spend more time with my treasure ones and stop being so childish.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify; margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
In grade 12, I had the chance to spend more time with my classmates and understand them more.
We had the opportunity to go to K9 and created memories there with our performance which represented the spirit of the class.
I still wish that I could spend more time with those I treasure the most.
Here are some photos of my K9.

This was our senior year, we didn't have much time left together as a class, unfortunately, we experienced staying at home due to COVID-19 twice.
One was after Tet holiday, and the other one was after 30/4 holiday.
We didn't see each other much due to this global epidemic, and we had to end the school year via Zoom. 
After that, we participated in University entrance exams, happily all of us did well, and most of us had been accepted to university a long time before the test is taken.

Whatever happened at high school is all important, as it either makes me fell happy or give me lessons for the future.
Thank you for coming and being a part of my life.
I really appreciate to have been accepted to such a wonderful school.
CNN, thank you for everything!
